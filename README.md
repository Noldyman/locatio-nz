# LocatioNZ

Quick and dirty application to keep track of the locations I might want to visit in New Zealand.

create a file `public/data/locations.csv` and use the following headers:
`Name` `Coordinates` `Description` `Links (separate by ,)` `Other sources (separate by ,)`

see `public/data/locationsExample.csv`
